# Transport Application

## Overview
The Transport Application is a robust and scalable solution designed to provide seamless user and admin functionalities for managing transportation services. The project is divided into two main sections:
- **Frontend**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations, following the MVC architecture.

The application is designed to be maintainable, secure, and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and administrators.

## Features

### Frontend
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's Context API for efficient state sharing across components.
- **Styling**: Combines Bootstrap for responsive layouts and `styled-components` for custom, reusable styles.
- **Routing**: Implements `react-router-dom` for seamless navigation and route management.
- **User Experience Enhancements**:
  - Integrated `react-icons` for visually appealing icons.
  - Added GSAP animations for transitions and hover effects to create a dynamic interface.

### Backend
- **User Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Built a User model for registration (signup) and login.
  - Secured routes with middleware for authentication and authorization.
  - Used `bcrypt` for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure role-based access.
- **Transport Management**:
  - Developed a Transport model to handle CRUD operations for transportation data.
- **Booking Management**:
  - Designed a Booking model for users to create bookings, view booking history, and retrieve details.
  - Admin functionalities include:
    - Viewing all bookings.
    - Updating booking statuses (e.g., Confirm, Cancel).
    - Managing customer bookings efficiently.
- **Backend Best Practices**:
  - Input validation for data integrity.
  - Comprehensive error handling for robust application behavior.
  - Database indexing for optimized query performance.
